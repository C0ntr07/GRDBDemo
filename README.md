# Writing a Swift iOS app with GRDB and FetchedRecordsController

This repository contains an iOS application that uses the SQLite library [GRDB.swift](http://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift).

It displays a simple Hall of Fame of people sorted by score, and demonstrates how the [FetchedRecordsController](http://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift#fetchedrecordscontroller) class can populate a table view, and automatically update its contents when the database is modified.
